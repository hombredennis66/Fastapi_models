## 2026-06-08 - [FastAPI & LLM Optimization]
**Learning:** Initializing heavy LLM pipelines during startup can significantly increase cold start time. Using `cached_property` for lazy loading and `lru_cache` for result caching provides immediate performance wins. Furthermore, in FastAPI, synchronous CPU-bound tasks like ML inference should use `def` instead of `async def` to avoid blocking the event loop.
**Action:** Always verify if heavy dependencies can be lazy-loaded and ensure CPU-intensive route handlers are not blocking the main event loop by using standard `def` in FastAPI.
