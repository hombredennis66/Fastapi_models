## 2026-06-08 - [FastAPI & LLM Optimization]
**Learning:** Initializing heavy LLM pipelines during startup can significantly increase cold start time. Using `cached_property` for lazy loading and `lru_cache` for result caching provides immediate performance wins. Furthermore, in FastAPI, synchronous CPU-bound tasks like ML inference should use `def` instead of `async def` to avoid blocking the event loop.
**Action:** Always verify if heavy dependencies can be lazy-loaded and ensure CPU-intensive route handlers are not blocking the main event loop by using standard `def` in FastAPI.

## 2026-06-09 - [Lazy Loading Transformers]
**Learning:** Top-level imports of heavy ML libraries like `transformers` can add seconds to the application startup time. In this environment, it accounted for over 70% of the cold-start duration.
**Action:** Move heavy library imports inside the specific methods or properties that use them to ensure they are only loaded when necessary.

## 2026-06-10 - [Lazy Loading Scikit-learn & NumPy]
**Learning:** Top-level imports of `numpy` and `joblib` plus loading a serialized model file (`.joblib`) during FastAPI startup adds significant overhead (e.g., ~3 seconds). Refactoring this into a service with `cached_property` and local imports deferred the cost until the first request.
**Action:** Move all heavy ML model loading and their dependencies into lazy-loaded properties to ensure near-instant application startup.

## 2026-06-20 - [ML Prediction Hot Path Optimization]
**Learning:** Passing a list of lists directly to Scikit-learn's `model.predict()` avoids the significant overhead of `numpy` array creation and reshaping for single-sample inference. Combining this with per-instance `lru_cache` (via a `cached_property` returning a closure) provides safe, massive performance wins for repeat requests without memory leaks or unhashable `self` issues.
**Action:** For single-sample ML inference, prefer native Python structures over `numpy` when supported by the model, and use per-instance memoization closures to optimize hot paths safely.
